# Typer Ain

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at [Typer Ain](https://brandonmartin101.github.io/bpm-typer-ain/).


## Project Description

Letters fall from the sky, and disappear when you type them on your keyboard. See how high you can get your score without letters touching the ground.


## Game Logic

- The player can type to eliminate falling characters
- Letters will spawn randomly from the top of the game area
- If a letter touches the bottom of the screen, it will glitch out and obscure your vision
- Increase your score by typing characters correctly
- Your score decreases when a letter touches the bottom, or when you type a character incorrectly
- High score is saved to show the highest your score got before defeat

### MVP Criteria

- Game must be playable
- Multiple rounds can be played
- Score is recorded

### Post-MVP Plans

- Letters should explode when typed
- Letters should glitch out when they hit the bottom (achieved)
- Some letters are faster than others
- High score is saved in localstorage for subsequent playthroughs (achieved)
